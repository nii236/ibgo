This is a pure Go interface to
[Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/)
[IB API](http://interactivebrokers.github.io). Features include:

* 100% pure Go (no Java/C calls)
* Idiomatic design (Go naming conventions, channels, error handling etc)
* Choice of low-level types or our high-level [Manager](manager.go) types
* Extensively tested (test coverage via
  [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/r/gofinance/ib?branch=master), CI via
  [Drone](https://drone.io/github.com/gofinance/ib/latest), local
  [test server](testserver/README.md))
* Documentation on [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/gofinance/ib)
* Reflects very up-to-date IB API version

Status
------

* The code presently supports IB API 971.01 (latest as of March 2014)
* All reply types (see [ereader.go](ereader.go)) are supported
* Some request types (see [eclientsocket.go](eclientsocket.go)) require porting

Testing
-------

```go test``` requires IB Gateway be running at 127.0.0.1:4002 and providing
access to a financial advisor account. Always use a demo or paper trade
account, as the tests may modify your account.

The easiest way to start IB Gateway with a financial advisor demo account is to
use the test server. Have a look at the
[test server instructions](testserver/README.md) for all the details.

By default the tests produce no output. If you'd like to view engine
communication logs during test execution, set the ```IB_ENGINE_DUMP```
environment variable to any value. For example, ```IB_ENGINE_DUMP=t go test```.

If you fork this project and would like to configure Drone and Coveralls for
your fork, our [Drone instructions](drone.md) should be of help.
